# 9.7-E-Paper-Calendar-software
An adaptation of the E-Paper-Calendar-with-iCal-sync-and-live-weather specifically for the 9.7" E-Paper

Currently in early alpha phase. Made for those who wish to adapt the "E-Paper-Calendar-with-iCal-sync-and-live-weather" software with the 9.7" E-Paper Display from waveshare.

### Disclaimer: Please do not confuse this repo with a fully fledged one. I do not have the 9.7" E-Paper display in my possession so there is absolutely no guarantee that this will even work. Also, I will not take responsibility for anything that is related to this software. Please use at your own risk.

Kind Note: If you wish to assist me in the development of this software, you are free to do so. Any help is welcome.
